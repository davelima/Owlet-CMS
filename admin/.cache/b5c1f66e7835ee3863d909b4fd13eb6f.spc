This integration with the alpha channel version on DO provides an easy and quick way for web and mobile developers interested in working with Docker to deploy applications and experiment with containers. On CoreOS, Docker containers can boot in milliseconds, providing unprecedented flexibility in managing load across a cluster of Droplets. Some additional features include automatic updates, automatic network configuration, and integration with etcd technology.</p>

<p>Through CoreOS’s etcd technology, users can deploy a cluster of servers configured to work with one another, ensuring the resiliency of their architecture. This feature greatly reduces the impact of a possible server failure, supporting high-traffic applications. And for those looking for commercial support, <a href="https://coreos.com/products/managed-linux/">CoreOS Managed Linux</a> is delivered as an OS as a Service. We hope developers using our infrastructure are as excited as we are about the possibilities now available through CoreOS on our platform.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/company/blog/coreos-now-available-on-digitalocean/coreOSdistribution-d03c217d.png" /></p>

<p>Google, Facebook, and Twitter utilize similar strategies to allow for growth and resilient systems. "The easiest way to get started using containers, distributed systems and the next generation of infrastructure is now available to millions of developers on DigitalOcean," said Alex Polvi, CEO of CoreOS. "Let the developer community go wild."</p>

<p>In return for helping us spread the word, we’ll give you $25 for each friend that signs up, once they are billed $25 as a DO customer. There is NO LIMIT to how many friends you can refer. You can potentially fund your entire account on DigitalOcean by simply <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/referral-program/">getting your friends to sign up</a> – we hope this shows how much we appreciate your support.</p>

<p>Within your <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/referrals">Settings page</a> in the control panel, you’ll be able to track your referral stats, e.g. how many friends you’ve referred, how much money you are owed, and how much you’ve earned so far. Email it, Tweet it, and share it. Thanks for spreading the DigitalOcean love!</p>

These core switches are also connected to one another and coordinate between themselves to allow a single bonded logical connection to each server rack through both cores. We always have sufficient capacity available on each core switch to handle all of our traffic so that we can continue operating normally if either core switch fails.</p>

<p>In addition to having fully redundant core switches, we also have redundant routing engines in each core switch. The routing engine is essentially the brain of the switch – it handles management functions and some higher level network protocols. This redundancy is intended to allow us to continue operating with core switch redundancy, even if we have a failure of a single routing engine in either core switch.</p>

<p>On Tuesday July 29 at 13:09 EST, the solid state disk in the active routing engine failed on one of our core switches. This triggered a failover to the backup routing engine, however the failover was not completely successful. As a result, the coordination that is necessary between the two core switches to present a single bonded link to the server racks was left in an inconsistent state. This, in turn, caused a portion of our network to be unreachable. We discovered the failed routing engine immediately, but it took us nearly an hour to fully understand that the failover was not completed successfully. Once we discovered this, we made the decision to completely isolate the broken core switch from the network moving all traffic over to the remaining core switch.</p>

<p>The recovery efforts were hampered by a recently discovered problem with the software on our core switches, which we believed may cause problems on the remaining switch if we moved all of our traffic to it. Since we had just finished qualifying a new version of the software in a pre-production environment, we made the decision to apply the update to the unaffected core switch before isolating the failed one. This added approximately 15 minutes to the recovery time, but ultimately put us in a stable position from which to continue operating until we could perform the necessary repairs on the affected switch.</p>

<p>We have been working around the clock since Tuesday to better understand the failures that happened, return the network to a fully redundant state, and make changes to our configuration and to our standard operating procedures to improve our ability to respond to similar failures in the future.</p>

<p>First, we repaired the broken core switch and successfully returned it to production restoring core switch redundancy. This was successfully completed on Wednesday evening. We also made the decision to isolate a single core switch from the network a standard troubleshooting procedure when we see similar unexplained traffic loss for part of our network in the future. This should allow us to respond quickly to this type of problem going forward.</p>

<p>As of Wednesday evening the network has been returned to its original configuration, all devices are fully redundant and functioning normally. We do not expect any further issues to recur at this time. We are confident that our NYC2 region has been stabilized.</p>

<p>We are working very closely with our networking partner to understand the nature of the failure, assess the chances of a repeat event, and to begin planning architectural changes for the future.</p>

<p>Our initial focus was on verifying the configuration so we initiated a line-by-line configuration review by engineers at our network partner in order to confirm that we have the most optimal settings for our architecture. Beyond validating the settings, we also asked them to test this configuration in their lab to ensure that it performs as expected on the hardware configuration and software versions that we are currently operating.</p>

<p>In parallel, we returned the broken routing engine for complete failure analysis and we hope to get more definitive answers about both the cause of the failure and why the backup routing engine was unable to successfully take over. We expect some preliminary findings on this over the next few days.</p>

<p>Finally, we’ve scheduled a full network review with the chief architect at our network partner to identify short term tactical changes that can make our network even more stable, as well as longer term architectural changes to support us going forward. We will be reviewing these suggestions early next week and making decisions about how to proceed.</p>

<p>We know that you rely on us to be online all the time. We appreciate your patience and continued support. We’ll do whatever it takes to ensure that your trust is well placed.</p>

<p>Since we use Ruby internally, we are providing our open source OAuth strategy for the community to use. The <a href="https://github.com/digitaloceancloud/omniauth-digitalocean">omniauth-digitalocean gem</a> is on Github and published to RubyGems. Based on <a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth">OmniAuth</a>, the widely used Rack-based library for multi-provider authentication, the gem is an easy way to integrate “sign in with DigitalOcean" into Rails and Rack frameworks. We are excited to join the <a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies">growing list</a> of providers with OmniAuth strategies.</p>

<p>We’ve also developed some community resources to help you get started with OAuth, including a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2">general intro to OAuth 2</a> and a tutorial on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-oauth-authentication-with-digitalocean-as-a-user-or-developer">how to use OAuth with DigitalOcean</a> both as a user and as a developer.</p>

<p>As we continue to refine our new API, we always appreciate any feedback on our <a href="https://github.com/digitaloceancloud/api-v2">API v2 Github page</a>. And if you want to let people know about what you’ve built, submit your applications to the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/projects">DigitalOcean projects page</a>.

<p>The Go package landscape is growing every day. People are sharing high quality code that prevents you from having to reinvent the wheel. There are packages that help you with tasks that range from implementing complex algorithms and building networking services to interfacing with other low level systems through the Go C bindings. </p>

<p>Given what's available, it's still a challenge to locate high quality packages to help you build your projects. Through word of mouth and on social channels (e.g. Twitter), I've found special gems like <a href="https://github.com/rcrowley/go-tigertonic">go-tigertonic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">testify</a>. Yes, we could have gotten by without them – but they provide benefits we don’t feel the need to replicate in-house.</p>

<p>There are also a few package repositories that exist; however, none of them can be considered a standard. There are announcement services like <a href="https://twitter.com/oss_go">OSS Go</a>, but they aren't helpful if you are looking for something specific. </p>

<p>While this remains an unsolved issue, Go has a secret weapon:</p>

<p>The standard library included with Go is incredibly robust, and unless you are looking for something industry specific or niche, there's a high probability the standard library has a complete solution – or the stepping stone to help you build a solution.</p>

<h2 id="integrating-with-external-code">Integrating With External Code</h2>

<p>As you start integrating packages written externally, you should take care to <em>use</em> the external packages and not <em>become</em> the external package. External API interfaces can change, or your team may decide that it needs to replace backend systems with something more robust. Use Go's interfaces to insulate your application from your imported package's types; in doing this, the focus will shift to fulfilling your project’s needs rather than building around a core you don’t own or have control over.</p>

<p>As an example, if you're using an external Redis client package, it exports the following:</p>

<pre><code>package redis

type Redis struct {}
func (r *Redis) Get(k string) (*RedisKVPair, error) { // omited}
</code></pre>

<p>You could use this code in your application, but you'll run into two problems: The first problem is that you'll need a Redis server if you ever want to test code that uses this package. The second is that you won't be able to easily upgrade or swap the Redis client out if you require additional functionality. </p>

<p>Using Go's powerful interfaces, you start specifying the behavior you desire:</p>

<pre><code>package myapp

type KeyPair struct {
  Key string
  Value []byte
}

type KeyStore interface {
  Get(k string) (*KeyPair, error)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you can create your own type that wraps the external dependency:</p>

<pre><code>package myapp

func NewRedisKeyStore() {
  return &amp;RedisKeyStore{
    r: redis.Redis{},
  }
}

func (rks *RedisKeyStore) Get(k string) (*KeyPair, error) {
  rkvp, err := rks.r.Get(k)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }

  return &amp;KeyPair{
    Key: rkvp.Key,
    Value: rkvp.Value,
  }, nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, instead of using the external Redis client explicitly, you can use your wrapper or swap it out in tests:</p>

<pre><code>type MockKeyStore struct {
  Dict map[string][]byte
}

func NewMockKeyStore() {
  return &amp;MockKeyStore{
    Dict: map[string][]byte{},
  }
}

func (mks *MockKeyStore) Get(k string) (*KeyPair, error) {
  return &amp;KeyPair{Key: k, Value: mks.Dict[k]}, nil
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="managing-dependencies">Managing Dependencies</h2>

<p>After a bit of time, packages you rely on will be updated to fix bugs and add new features. You will quickly learn that <code>go get</code> is not a robust solution for maintaining and organizing dependencies. There are two solutions here that you can try: vendoring your dependencies or using an external tool such as <a href="https://github.com/tools/godep">godep</a>. </p>

<p>The team evaluated vendoring packages but found out quickly that it can be overwhelming. Hence, we are currently leaning towards using godep to manage our dependencies. It provides a method for ensuring that an explicit package is used. Keep in mind it doesn't do so in a declarative manner, so you have to make sure you have the proper version installed prior to saving with godep.</p>

<p>While our engineering team has a strong grasp on managing our dependencies, this too remains an unsolved problem. There still isn’t a simple, Go community accepted, declarative solution that allows us to specify external dependencies and the exact versions we want to use.  The community is working on it, however, and a few solutions exist for your team to evaluate at the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/PackageManagementTools">Go Wiki Tools Page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="writing-go">Writing Go</h2>

<p>One thing your team may appreciate about Go is that it doesn't require a resource heavy IDE to be productive. You can use your already-familiar text editor and start writing code. If you do this without any research though, you will be missing out on extensions that can help your productivity. I use Sublime Text for writing Go, and the popular <a href="https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime">GoSublime</a> plugin provides features like code completion and formatting. Other team members use <a href="https://github.com/fatih/vim-go">Vim Go</a> with large amounts of success.</p>

<p>Another tool to keep an eye on is <a href="https://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.tools/oracle">Oracle</a> – it provides source analysis that will aid you in navigating your projects. From evaluating expressions to understanding types and callees, Oracle integration in editors will be a huge productivity boost to developers. You can try it out today if you use Emacs or the <a href="https://atom.io/packages/go-oracle">Atom package</a>.</p>

<p>Our team has settled on a single workspace with multiple repositories. As mentioned above, it’s still the early days of dependency management, but since we ensure that the team works on all projects in a similar manner, multiple people are able to work with multiple projects simultaneously without any major problems.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-go">Deploying Go</h2>

<p>After writing your software, you'll want to run it in production. Use a tool like fpm to build debs and RPMs and deploy those to your production. You'll get the value of being able to deploy from an internal repository with an explicit version. Since Go compiles down to a single binary, there will be no dependencies to manage. </p>

<p>As an example, you can create a Makefile to build a deb:</p>

<pre><code>VERSION=0.5.0
BUILD=$(shell git rev-list --count HEAD)

widget-dpkg:
  mkdir -p deb/widget/usr/local/bin
  cp $(GOPATH)/bin/widget  deb/widget/usr/local/bin
  fpm -s dir -t deb -n widget -v $(VERSION)-$(BUILD) -C deb/widget .
</code></pre>

<p>Before thinking of creating packages by hand, consider using your continuous integration system as the builder. This way you'll be guaranteed an up-to-date package after every successful build. We are currently using <a href="https://drone.io/">Drone.IO</a> for continuous integration. We're also moving to Makefiles for automating tasks, which are well known and a great way to ensure that everyone who touches the code can test and build it.</p>

<h2 id="taking-advantage-of-gos-ecosystem">Taking Advantage Of Go's Ecosystem</h2>

<p>Go provides tools to make it easier to work within its ecosystem. The DO team uses <code>golint</code> which finds simple mistakes and ensures that everything has at least a minimal set of documentation. With <code>godoc</code> we have an easy to use interface for viewing the documentation for all the code that our projects contain. The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts">Golang Nuts</a> mailing list is an invaluable resource. </p>

<p>So far, our short foray into Go has been a great success. Developers not familiar with the language have ramped up and become productive quickly. The language's speed of development, coupled with its easy-to-grasp concurrency, has allowed to us to write better software in a faster manner. We experimented with Go while rewriting our <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/new-super-fast-droplet-console-thanks-golang/">Droplet Console</a>, and that experience has given us the confidence to move forward on multiple new projects. </p>

<p>If your team hasn't tried Go, it should be on your short list. </p>

<h2 id="write-go-for-do">Write Go For DO</h2>

<p>As we continue to write new services, as well as rewrite old ones, we grow a deeper appreciation for the language’s strength in building distributed systems.

When your application needs more storage, Elastic Deployments is there with its autoscaling technology to match all your demands.</p>

<p>Elastic Deployments are designed to work on the most performant cloud hosting platforms available, so it was natural for us to <a href="https://www.mongohq.com/digitalocean">connect with DigitalOcean</a>. Our CEO Kurt Mackey puts it best: "Developers want to host their applications with DigitalOcean primarily for the same reasons that they deploy databases through MongoHQ – to keep agility and flexibility while retaining power on demand."</p>

<p>DigitalOcean offers the same kind of rapid provisioning for cloud instances that MongoHQ offers for MongoDB databases. It takes less than a minute to bring up an SSD Cloud instance complete with 20GB of SSD storage and 512MB of RAM. There's easy to use dashboards and APIs, Tier-1 peering and virtual private networks within the data centre – that’s the kind of service we love at MongoHQ, and our partnership means that developers can leverage the perfect dovetail of hosting and database provisioning.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean has also been great to work with, providing us with extensive system access to benchmark and test our platform, as well as connecting us with three of their engineers. It's because of that collaboration that we're having a smooth rollout – we're production ready for DigitalOcean users <a href="https://www.mongohq.com/signup/?utm_source=Digital%20Ocean&amp;amp;utm_medium=lp&amp;amp;utm_campaign=digital%20ocean">right now</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new">What’s New?</h2>

<p>We’ve worked on making the new API as streamlined and easy to use as possible. Some new added features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A truly RESTful API:</strong> Developers can now communicate with the API through standard HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE &amp; HEAD.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved Authentication:</strong> Users can create and authorize API tokens to provide read-only or read/write access to their account without exposing their credentials.</li>
  <li><strong>OAuth Applications:</strong> As the beta progresses, third party application developers will be able to easily create and integrate their applications on top of the new API.</li>
  <li><strong>Slugs:</strong> Developers can now use slugs to reference sizes, regions, domains, public SSH keys, and public images in addition to the numeric IDs.</li>
  <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> Results are now paginated where applicable, making it easier to interact with large collections such as a domain with hundreds of records.</li>
  <li><strong>Expanded API Coverage:</strong> The new API supports IPv6 actions, such as creating a droplet with IPv6 enabled and enabling IPv6 on existing Singapore servers. Furthermore, developers now have the ability to change their Droplet’s kernel, making upgrades using the API much more seamless.</li>

<p>We're bootstrapping Track:js, so we're perpetually short on time and money. We initially started using DigitalOcean for its price, but have stayed for nearly a year now because it works so well. Setting up Droplets is super easy and we have all the control we need to automate them. </p>

<p>Their systems are also incredibly fast and reliable, handling everything we've thrown at them. We hit #1 on HackerNews and saw 25,000 unique users hit our DO box and performance was stellar: less than 1s response on average. We host our public-facing sites on DigitalOcean using a combination of static files and WordPress. Deployment is automated with git hooks, which were straightforward to setup. </p>

<p>DigitalOcean has been so great for us that we're looking to build out our usage capture components on a cluster of Droplets. We're very optimistic about this – it could save us a ton in monthly transactional costs and give us even more control. </p>

<h3 id="more-than-the-error">More than the Error</h3>

<p><img alt="" src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/blog/Track:js/telemetry.jpg" /></p>

<p>The error is the last in a long series of events. What happened before, what did the user do, and how did we get into this state? We built a custom event engine to track what the user, the network, and your application were doing leading up to the error. We call it the Telemetry Timeline – it's kinda like a BlackBox Recorder for your web app.</p>

<h3 id="realtime-analytics">Realtime Analytics</h3>

<p><img alt="" src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/blog/Track:js/dashboard.jpg" /></p>

<p>There is a lot of noise out there. A lot of errors are beyond your control. Our Analytics Dashboard helps you focus on the biggest impact. See the browsers, pages, or customers that are having the hardest time. Measure your app over time and see how your error rate changes.</p>

<h3 id="putting-service-in-saas">Putting Service in SaaS</h3>

<p>We're here to help you build a better app. My team and I are always <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#110;&#111;&#116;&#105;&#102;&#121;&#064;&#116;&#114;&#097;&#099;&#107;&#106;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">working with customers</a> to integrate, improve, and fix issues of all kinds. We now receive over 1,500 JavaScript errors per minute. To ensure that we can keep up with that load and continue to scale, we leverage DigitalOcean's API to quickly spin up a dozen Droplets and hammer our systems with errors for performance testing. We build out an "error drone" template, which rapid fires fake requests at us, then create a swarm of them on demand. As a DigitalOcean user, you pay hourly for the test and tear them down. No other service is offering that kind of speed and simplicity.</p>

His vast experience in operations and his passion for empowering developers is a contagious energy that's ignited our engineering team.</p>

<h2 id="a-decade-as-a-developer">A Decade As A Developer</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/markimbriaco">Mark</a> left school to found his own startup with a few friends: a web-hosting company called <strong>Internet Presence and Publishing</strong> which they later changed to <strong>iTribe</strong>. Their seed money came from a co-founder's father, and the little bit of cash was used to pay for "a tiny office, crappy furniture, and an internet connection."  But with a child on the way, Mark left the struggling startup to join a company where he could make some real money.</p>

<p>He would soon land a job building <strong>AOL</strong> web services in the late 90's when everyone was using them. "It was a lot of fun, I mean, you've got 50 million people on the Internet and 25+ are connecting through AOL." </p>

<p>It was at this moment that I became a litte starstruck. Growing up as a kid, AOL and Netscape.com were the heart of the internet.</p>

<p>But he wouldn't stay there long – his family hated living in Northern Virginia. Sacrificing one of the coolest jobs on the planet, Mark synced back up with a co-founder of iTribe to hack on <strong>html.com</strong> and <strong>christmas.com</strong>. "The latter doesn't show up on LinkedIn because it's so ridiculous," he jokes. But there was unforeseen value in picking up those highly desirable domain names. Although the startup didn't take off, they sold the domains (and many others) to help fund the business and pay back investors. “I was proud we were able to do that – particularly my friend's father who put down the initial seed money."   </p>

<p>To most of us, leaving the biggest Internet company in the world to take a second chance on a startup may seem a little too risky. But following your heart is one of his biggest pieces of advice for young developers. </p>

<h2 id="transitioning-to-operational-roles">Transitioning To Operational Roles</h2>

<p>Afterwards, Mark was a Java developer at <a href="http://www.decisiv.com/">Decisiv</a> for ﬁve years during the early 2000s, switching to Ruby and Rails for the last year of his tenure. When 37signals, now <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, went looking for a system administrator to help scale their systems, Mark jumped at the chance to get back into Ops work. He designed and managed the infrastructure powering Basecamp, Campﬁre, Highrise and all of the 37signals apps. After four years of massive growth, having become the Operations Manager and building a great team along the way, he decided he was ready to make a change.</p>

<p>This was a crucial moment for Mark –  at this point he's one of the most experienced people in the world at running Rails apps. And so at the peak of his career and overflowing with knowledge he decided to join Heroku. Over his two years at the PaaS, the company went from hosting 60,000 apps to over 1.5 million. </p>

<p>But with nowhere to go but up, Mark Imbriaco made what he refers to as "the biggest mistake of my career."</p>

<p>Mark had a few friends at <a href="https://www.livingsocial.com/">LivingSocial</a> and felt restless working for Heroku after the Salesforce acquisition. But after joining, he realized he wasn't very passionate about daily deals."That was the biggest mistake I made," he says, "going somewhere I didn't care about the product."</p>

<h2 id="departing-from-github">Departing From GitHub</h2>

<p>A year later <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> exploded with a huge <a href="https://gigaom.com/2012/07/09/github-finally-raises-funding-100m-from-andreessen-horowitz/">$100 Million Series A from Andreessen Horowitz</a>. Mark had known the founders for years and "believes in Marc Andreessen's assertion that software is eating the world and that developers are making that happen." Unlike his time at LivingSocial, Mark was passionate about building systems, tools and services that allow developers to work together.
Despite the lack of vertical structure, Mark showcased his natural leadership while heading the move into their own colocation facility. He also worked on strategies for updating the public status at GitHub. </p>

<p>"Whenever I wrote a post-mortem at GitHub, I didn't ask anybody before I published them. I would get feedback on grammar and wording from the team, but I didn't need to go to the CEO and ask. It was part of the culture and everyone wanted to be transparent."</p>

<p><strong>Mark explains his formula for writing an ideal post-mortem:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Apologize for what happened.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demonstrate you understand what happened. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain what you will do to reduce the likelihood of it happening again.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you're honest to customers and come off as genuinely empathetic, he explains, then you can turn a bad situation into the opposite – into something that actually builds confidence with your users.</p>

<p>Realizing his expertise could have a greater impact with a team underneath him, Mark decided to leave GitHub. When I asked what he was looking for in a new company, he responded simply "a place where I could have a bigger impact on a business with a product I cared about. I wasn't willing to sacrifice either of those this time." After speaking with Ben and Moisey, he decided DigitalOcean was that place.</p>

<h2 id="vp-of-techops-at-digitalocean">VP Of TechOps At DigitalOcean</h2>

<p>We finished our conversation by discussing his <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/imbriaco">evolution from a developer to more operational roles</a>. "I still like to get my hands dirty," Mark tells me. "I like to write code, I like to hack on things." But at this point in his life, he feels he can provide the most value when helping other people succeed. It took a long time and a lot of heartache along the way to settle into this new role – but now he couldn't be happier.</p>

<p>“I think it’s typical of engineers to reach a certain level and feel there’s really nowhere to go but management. But management is not the continuation of an engineering career, it’s really starting over in a new discipline. You can either embrace this truth immediately, which is incredibly rare, or you take the role and rail against it for a while and complain about being in meetings all the time instead of writing code." </p>

<p>Mark likes to call it the "seven stages of technical grief." But he's come out the other side having a healthier perspective on things.</p>

<p>"I want to help other people succeed. I want to help grow teams. I want people on my team to have careers that are even more successful than mine. And I want to help expand our field because internet operations, and really anything web related, is just over 20 years old at this point. We're learning new things every day."</p>

You can set up your billing alert by clicking on the <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings">settings icon</a>. There you'll see a section called <strong>Billing Alerts</strong> where you can adjust the threshold for your account. By default, we've set it to 125% of the average of your last three months of invoices (or $20, whichever is greater). If your Monthly Usage goes over the limit set, you will receive an email alerting you once per billing cycle. </p>

Using Go, we were able to dramatically decrease load and connection times from seconds to milliseconds. Aside from the immediate benefits, the console is also much more reliable and scalable.</p>

<p><strong>What benefits did we get from using Go?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Goroutines made it easy to duplex the tcp and websocket connections, allowing us to dramatically improve the speed of the entire service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interfaces allowed us to build end to end testing, ensuring future updates are easier to ship and bugs can be fixed quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go’s built in net/http package means we are able to do live deploys and keep on-going development invisible to users. In fact, the three or four times that we have deployed code to the console since we switched to the new version were done with no interruptions or customer tickets being opened.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go’s package system makes sharing code incredibly easy. That means we can share the code developed for the new console between projects seamlessly.</p>

<p>As the receiver, you will have a new section on the <code>Images</code> page titled <strong>Pending Snapshot Transfer Requests</strong>. Here you'll be able to accept or decline the transfer request. If approved, the snapshot will disappear from the original user's account, as well as be added to your list of <code>Snapshots</code> where you'll have full control over the image.</p>

<p>This is one of many exciting rollouts to celebrate the coming of Spring :)</p>

<p><em><strong>Just a heads up:</strong> as transferring a snapshot maintains all of the original snapshot’s settings, there may be configuration that allows the sender to potentially later access droplets created from the image. Make sure you trust anyone who gives you an image.</em></p>

This is a serious vulnerability that will affect many websites and applications on the internet. As the <a href="https://heartbleed.com/">researchers have said</a>:</p>

<p>“Without using any privileged information or credentials we were able steal from ourselves the secret keys used for our X.509 certificates, user names and passwords, instant messages, emails and business critical documents and communication.”</p>

<p><strong>What have we done?</strong></p>

<p>As soon as this vulnerability was disclosed to us, we immediately began the process of patching our internal systems to use the latest secured version of OpenSSL and updating our mirrors.  By noon today, all our infrastructure was updated and our certificates reissued, securing our internal and external facing assets and revoking our old certs.</p>

<p><strong>What should you do?</strong></p>

<p>We advise our customers to follow the steps that we have taken for our own systems (where applicable)  to secure your own droplets. At this point, we have no reason to believe that any credentials have been compromised, but to be on the safe side we recommend you change your DigitalOcean.com and Droplet passwords.  Using the same password elsewhere (ill-advised in any case) may lead to your password being rendered unsafe again.</p>

<p>We also recommend you make a few precautions as a part of your normal workflow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a password manager that allows you to create strong passwords that are unique for every service you use.</li>
  <li>Enable two-factor-authentication for any critical infrastructure services you use.</li>
  <li>Periodically roll over your DigitalOcean API keys.  This means that you will have to <a href="https://digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-api">re-issue your API key</a> via the DigitalOcean.com control panel for any applications configured to use your old key.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are in the process of updating all of our installation images so that any new servers will be patched against this vulnerability from the time of deployment.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When our community site first launched in the spring of 2012, it featured ten Linux tutorials written by an in-house writer and received roughly 1,500 visitors its first week. We’re so grateful that as we’ve grown, the community has come together to sustain the site. Currently, over 50% of DigitalOcean’s near &lt;a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials'&gt;800 tutorials&lt;/a&gt; come from outside submissions, and our &lt;a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions'&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/community/projects'&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; sections are also built up by community contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style="font-size: 23px"&gt;Now the community site receives over 1.5 million visitors each month.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve put a lot of time and effort into creating a space where we can give back, and that developers of all types can call home. Today, are excited to announce some of the biggest new features of the growing DO community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have introduced quite a few new features to the community, and will continue improving these features and adding more based on user feedback. Some of our newest features are:&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot of community excitement for &lt;a href="https://coreos.com/"&gt;CoreOS&lt;/a&gt;. This integration with the alpha channel version on DO provides an easy and quick way for web and mobile developers interested in working with Docker to deploy applications and experiment with containers. On CoreOS, Docker containers can boot in milliseconds, providing unprecedented flexibility in managing load across a cluster of Droplets. Some additional features include automatic updates, automatic network configuration, and integration with etcd technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through CoreOS’s etcd technology, users can deploy a cluster of servers configured to work with one another, ensuring the resiliency of their architecture. This feature greatly reduces the impact of a possible server failure, supporting high-traffic applications. And for those looking for commercial support, &lt;a href="https://coreos.com/products/managed-linux/"&gt;CoreOS Managed Linux&lt;/a&gt; is delivered as an OS as a Service. We hope developers using our infrastructure are as excited as we are about the possibilities now available through CoreOS on our platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/company/blog/coreos-now-available-on-digitalocean/coreOSdistribution-d03c217d.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, Facebook, and Twitter utilize similar strategies to allow for growth and resilient systems. "The easiest way to get started using containers, distributed systems and the next generation of infrastructure is now available to millions of developers on DigitalOcean," said Alex Polvi, CEO of CoreOS. "Let the developer community go wild."&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works: anyone you refer to DigitalOcean that signs up using your &lt;a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/referrals"&gt;unique referral link&lt;/a&gt; will receive $10 in hosting credit immediately after unlocking their account by entering a valid payment method. What this essentially means is you have an unlimited amount of promo codes that you can shell out to your friends. Hopefully, they’ll return the favor by taking you out for a drink, which, here in New York, means they’ve already spent their credit…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In return for helping us spread the word, we’ll give you $25 for each friend that signs up, once they are billed $25 as a DO customer. There is NO LIMIT to how many friends you can refer. You can potentially fund your entire account on DigitalOcean by simply &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/referral-program/"&gt;getting your friends to sign up&lt;/a&gt; – we hope this shows how much we appreciate your support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within your &lt;a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/referrals"&gt;Settings page&lt;/a&gt; in the control panel, you’ll be able to track your referral stats, e.g. how many friends you’ve referred, how much money you are owed, and how much you’ve earned so far. Email it, Tweet it, and share it. Thanks for spreading the DigitalOcean love!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Network Instability in NYC2 on July 29, 2014 </title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our network is designed with a pair of core switches that each of the server racks are connected to. These core switches are also connected to one another and coordinate between themselves to allow a single bonded logical connection to each server rack through both cores. We always have sufficient capacity available on each core switch to handle all of our traffic so that we can continue operating normally if either core switch fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to having fully redundant core switches, we also have redundant routing engines in each core switch. The routing engine is essentially the brain of the switch – it handles management functions and some higher level network protocols. This redundancy is intended to allow us to continue operating with core switch redundancy, even if we have a failure of a single routing engine in either core switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday July 29 at 13:09 EST, the solid state disk in the active routing engine failed on one of our core switches. This triggered a failover to the backup routing engine, however the failover was not completely successful. As a result, the coordination that is necessary between the two core switches to present a single bonded link to the server racks was left in an inconsistent state. This, in turn, caused a portion of our network to be unreachable. We discovered the failed routing engine immediately, but it took us nearly an hour to fully understand that the failover was not completed successfully. Once we discovered this, we made the decision to completely isolate the broken core switch from the network moving all traffic over to the remaining core switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recovery efforts were hampered by a recently discovered problem with the software on our core switches, which we believed may cause problems on the remaining switch if we moved all of our traffic to it. Since we had just finished qualifying a new version of the software in a pre-production environment, we made the decision to apply the update to the unaffected core switch before isolating the failed one. This added approximately 15 minutes to the recovery time, but ultimately put us in a stable position from which to continue operating until we could perform the necessary repairs on the affected switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working around the clock since Tuesday to better understand the failures that happened, return the network to a fully redundant state, and make changes to our configuration and to our standard operating procedures to improve our ability to respond to similar failures in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we repaired the broken core switch and successfully returned it to production restoring core switch redundancy. This was successfully completed on Wednesday evening. We also made the decision to isolate a single core switch from the network a standard troubleshooting procedure when we see similar unexplained traffic loss for part of our network in the future. This should allow us to respond quickly to this type of problem going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday evening the network has been returned to its original configuration, all devices are fully redundant and functioning normally. We do not expect any further issues to recur at this time. We are confident that our NYC2 region has been stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working very closely with our networking partner to understand the nature of the failure, assess the chances of a repeat event, and to begin planning architectural changes for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our initial focus was on verifying the configuration so we initiated a line-by-line configuration review by engineers at our network partner in order to confirm that we have the most optimal settings for our architecture. Beyond validating the settings, we also asked them to test this configuration in their lab to ensure that it performs as expected on the hardware configuration and software versions that we are currently operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, we returned the broken routing engine for complete failure analysis and we hope to get more definitive answers about both the cause of the failure and why the backup routing engine was unable to successfully take over. We expect some preliminary findings on this over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ve scheduled a full network review with the chief architect at our network partner to identify short term tactical changes that can make our network even more stable, as well as longer term architectural changes to support us going forward. We will be reviewing these suggestions early next week and making decisions about how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that you rely on us to be online all the time. We appreciate your patience and continued support. We’ll do whatever it takes to ensure that your trust is well placed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Integrate Your Apps With Our API Using OAuth</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Prior to OAuth support, applications that used the API required users to supply their personal access token, a manual and inconvenient process. The new OAuth flow, available in APIv2, is much better suited for web applications, as users can safely and easily provide access to their accounts through a DigitalOcean authorization request page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Authorize Application page" src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/blog/integrate-your-apps-with-our-api-using-oauth/authorize_application.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, users can view and revoke account access to authorized applications within the &lt;a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications"&gt;DigitalOcean control panel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="getting-started"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we use Ruby internally, we are providing our open source OAuth strategy for the community to use. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/digitaloceancloud/omniauth-digitalocean"&gt;omniauth-digitalocean gem&lt;/a&gt; is on Github and published to RubyGems. Based on &lt;a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth"&gt;OmniAuth&lt;/a&gt;, the widely used Rack-based library for multi-provider authentication, the gem is an easy way to integrate “sign in with DigitalOcean" into Rails and Rack frameworks. We are excited to join the &lt;a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies"&gt;growing list&lt;/a&gt; of providers with OmniAuth strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also developed some community resources to help you get started with OAuth, including a &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2"&gt;general intro to OAuth 2&lt;/a&gt; and a tutorial on &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-oauth-authentication-with-digitalocean-as-a-user-or-developer"&gt;how to use OAuth with DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt; both as a user and as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue to refine our new API, we always appreciate any feedback on our &lt;a href="https://github.com/digitaloceancloud/api-v2"&gt;API v2 Github page&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to let people know about what you’ve built, submit your applications to the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/projects"&gt;DigitalOcean projects page&lt;/a&gt;. We’re excited to highlight the great work of the DO community. &lt;/p&gt;

It is through our users’ support that we have now been able to expand to five regions globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London is experiencing a boom in tech and entrepreneurship that looks very similar to NYC’s own tech expansion a few years ago, and we want to provide innovative companies in the United Kingdom with the infrastructure they need to grow and succeed. Additionally, we want to ensure that UK developers can comply with data privacy regulations by having a native facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPv6 and private networking are available for Droplets deployed in the new London region. We are excited to see what is developed in the London datacenter and look forward to offering more DigitalOcean regions around the world as we continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t yet met Sammy, he’s a big help when talking with our community. He’s there when we &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/we-re-excited-to-announce-our-singapore-datacenter-sgp1/"&gt;announce a new datacenter location&lt;/a&gt;, when we &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/happy-thanksgiving-from-sammy-the-turkey/"&gt;give thanks for all the love and support&lt;/a&gt;, and even when we’re &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/88664728"&gt;partying down at SXSW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, after 3 years, 2 round raises, 2 million Droplets launched, and over 150,000 developers using our platform, Sammy feels a little more grown up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we asked for help from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonoxleee"&gt;Simon Oxley&lt;/a&gt; – designer of graphics and muppet mascots, creator of the original Twitter bird and &lt;a href="https://octodex.github.com/"&gt;Github's Octocat&lt;/a&gt; – to give Sammy some special treatment. Now Sammy looks amazing and feels better than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here's the new and improved Sammy The Shark:&lt;/p&gt;

There are packages that help you with tasks that range from implementing complex algorithms and building networking services to interfacing with other low level systems through the Go C bindings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given what's available, it's still a challenge to locate high quality packages to help you build your projects. Through word of mouth and on social channels (e.g. Twitter), I've found special gems like &lt;a href="https://github.com/rcrowley/go-tigertonic"&gt;go-tigertonic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify"&gt;testify&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, we could have gotten by without them – but they provide benefits we don’t feel the need to replicate in-house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a few package repositories that exist; however, none of them can be considered a standard. There are announcement services like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oss_go"&gt;OSS Go&lt;/a&gt;, but they aren't helpful if you are looking for something specific. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this remains an unsolved issue, Go has a secret weapon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard library included with Go is incredibly robust, and unless you are looking for something industry specific or niche, there's a high probability the standard library has a complete solution – or the stepping stone to help you build a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="integrating-with-external-code"&gt;Integrating With External Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you start integrating packages written externally, you should take care to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the external packages and not &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; the external package. External API interfaces can change, or your team may decide that it needs to replace backend systems with something more robust. Use Go's interfaces to insulate your application from your imported package's types; in doing this, the focus will shift to fulfilling your project’s needs rather than building around a core you don’t own or have control over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, if you're using an external Redis client package, it exports the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package redis

type Redis struct {}
func (r *Redis) Get(k string) (*RedisKVPair, error) { // omited}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could use this code in your application, but you'll run into two problems: The first problem is that you'll need a Redis server if you ever want to test code that uses this package. The second is that you won't be able to easily upgrade or swap the Redis client out if you require additional functionality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Go's powerful interfaces, you start specifying the behavior you desire:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package myapp

type KeyPair struct {
  Key string
  Value []byte
}

type KeyStore interface {
  Get(k string) (*KeyPair, error)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you can create your own type that wraps the external dependency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package myapp

func NewRedisKeyStore() {
  return &amp;amp;RedisKeyStore{
    r: redis.Redis{},
  }
}

func (rks *RedisKeyStore) Get(k string) (*KeyPair, error) {
  rkvp, err := rks.r.Get(k)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }

  return &amp;amp;KeyPair{
    Key: rkvp.Key,
    Value: rkvp.Value,
  }, nil
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, instead of using the external Redis client explicitly, you can use your wrapper or swap it out in tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type MockKeyStore struct {
  Dict map[string][]byte
}

func NewMockKeyStore() {
  return &amp;amp;MockKeyStore{
    Dict: map[string][]byte{},
  }
}

func (mks *MockKeyStore) Get(k string) (*KeyPair, error) {
  return &amp;amp;KeyPair{Key: k, Value: mks.Dict[k]}, nil
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id="managing-dependencies"&gt;Managing Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of time, packages you rely on will be updated to fix bugs and add new features. You will quickly learn that &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt; is not a robust solution for maintaining and organizing dependencies. There are two solutions here that you can try: vendoring your dependencies or using an external tool such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/tools/godep"&gt;godep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team evaluated vendoring packages but found out quickly that it can be overwhelming. Hence, we are currently leaning towards using godep to manage our dependencies. It provides a method for ensuring that an explicit package is used. Keep in mind it doesn't do so in a declarative manner, so you have to make sure you have the proper version installed prior to saving with godep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While our engineering team has a strong grasp on managing our dependencies, this too remains an unsolved problem. There still isn’t a simple, Go community accepted, declarative solution that allows us to specify external dependencies and the exact versions we want to use.  The community is working on it, however, and a few solutions exist for your team to evaluate at the &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/PackageManagementTools"&gt;Go Wiki Tools Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="writing-go"&gt;Writing Go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing your team may appreciate about Go is that it doesn't require a resource heavy IDE to be productive. You can use your already-familiar text editor and start writing code. If you do this without any research though, you will be missing out on extensions that can help your productivity. I use Sublime Text for writing Go, and the popular &lt;a href="https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime"&gt;GoSublime&lt;/a&gt; plugin provides features like code completion and formatting. Other team members use &lt;a href="https://github.com/fatih/vim-go"&gt;Vim Go&lt;/a&gt; with large amounts of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tool to keep an eye on is &lt;a href="https://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.tools/oracle"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; – it provides source analysis that will aid you in navigating your projects. From evaluating expressions to understanding types and callees, Oracle integration in editors will be a huge productivity boost to developers. You can try it out today if you use Emacs or the &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/go-oracle"&gt;Atom package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team has settled on a single workspace with multiple repositories. As mentioned above, it’s still the early days of dependency management, but since we ensure that the team works on all projects in a similar manner, multiple people are able to work with multiple projects simultaneously without any major problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="deploying-go"&gt;Deploying Go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing your software, you'll want to run it in production. Use a tool like fpm to build debs and RPMs and deploy those to your production. You'll get the value of being able to deploy from an internal repository with an explicit version. Since Go compiles down to a single binary, there will be no dependencies to manage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, you can create a Makefile to build a deb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;VERSION=0.5.0
BUILD=$(shell git rev-list --count HEAD)

widget-dpkg:
  mkdir -p deb/widget/usr/local/bin
  cp $(GOPATH)/bin/widget  deb/widget/usr/local/bin
  fpm -s dir -t deb -n widget -v $(VERSION)-$(BUILD) -C deb/widget .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before thinking of creating packages by hand, consider using your continuous integration system as the builder. This way you'll be guaranteed an up-to-date package after every successful build. We are currently using &lt;a href="https://drone.io/"&gt;Drone.IO&lt;/a&gt; for continuous integration. We're also moving to Makefiles for automating tasks, which are well known and a great way to ensure that everyone who touches the code can test and build it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="taking-advantage-of-gos-ecosystem"&gt;Taking Advantage Of Go's Ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go provides tools to make it easier to work within its ecosystem. The DO team uses &lt;code&gt;golint&lt;/code&gt; which finds simple mistakes and ensures that everything has at least a minimal set of documentation. With &lt;code&gt;godoc&lt;/code&gt; we have an easy to use interface for viewing the documentation for all the code that our projects contain. The &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts"&gt;Golang Nuts&lt;/a&gt; mailing list is an invaluable resource. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, our short foray into Go has been a great success. Developers not familiar with the language have ramped up and become productive quickly. The language's speed of development, coupled with its easy-to-grasp concurrency, has allowed to us to write better software in a faster manner. We experimented with Go while rewriting our &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/new-super-fast-droplet-console-thanks-golang/"&gt;Droplet Console&lt;/a&gt;, and that experience has given us the confidence to move forward on multiple new projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your team hasn't tried Go, it should be on your short list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="write-go-for-do"&gt;Write Go For DO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue to write new services, as well as rewrite old ones, we grow a deeper appreciation for the language’s strength in building distributed systems. If you’re a software engineer that’s interested in writing Go – &lt;a href="https://careers.digitalocean.com/careers/software-engineer/"&gt;we are hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, and if you have experience writing Go, feel free to comment below and share your thoughts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are unfamiliar with MongoHQ’s new feature, Elastic Deployments offer a rapid route to a full power MongoDB system, complete with advanced features like oplog access for integration with other databases or high data performance web frameworks like Meteor. When your application needs more storage, Elastic Deployments is there with its autoscaling technology to match all your demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elastic Deployments are designed to work on the most performant cloud hosting platforms available, so it was natural for us to &lt;a href="https://www.mongohq.com/digitalocean"&gt;connect with DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;. Our CEO Kurt Mackey puts it best: "Developers want to host their applications with DigitalOcean primarily for the same reasons that they deploy databases through MongoHQ – to keep agility and flexibility while retaining power on demand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean offers the same kind of rapid provisioning for cloud instances that MongoHQ offers for MongoDB databases. It takes less than a minute to bring up an SSD Cloud instance complete with 20GB of SSD storage and 512MB of RAM. There's easy to use dashboards and APIs, Tier-1 peering and virtual private networks within the data centre – that’s the kind of service we love at MongoHQ, and our partnership means that developers can leverage the perfect dovetail of hosting and database provisioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean has also been great to work with, providing us with extensive system access to benchmark and test our platform, as well as connecting us with three of their engineers. It's because of that collaboration that we're having a smooth rollout – we're production ready for DigitalOcean users &lt;a href="https://www.mongohq.com/signup/?utm_source=Digital%20Ocean&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=lp&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=digital%20ocean"&gt;right now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>API v2.0 Enters Public Beta</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While version 1 of our API is still available for use, the new and improved version 2 of our API will allow you to manage a wider variety of DigitalOcean actions in a RESTful way. The endpoints are intuitive and powerful, helping you to easily make calls to retrieve information or to execute actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="whats-new"&gt;What’s New?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve worked on making the new API as streamlined and easy to use as possible. Some new added features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A truly RESTful API:&lt;/strong&gt; Developers can now communicate with the API through standard HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE &amp;amp; HEAD.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Authentication:&lt;/strong&gt; Users can create and authorize API tokens to provide read-only or read/write access to their account without exposing their credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OAuth Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; As the beta progresses, third party application developers will be able to easily create and integrate their applications on top of the new API.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slugs:&lt;/strong&gt; Developers can now use slugs to reference sizes, regions, domains, public SSH keys, and public images in addition to the numeric IDs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pagination:&lt;/strong&gt; Results are now paginated where applicable, making it easier to interact with large collections such as a domain with hundreds of records.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanded API Coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; The new API supports IPv6 actions, such as creating a droplet with IPv6 enabled and enabling IPv6 on existing Singapore servers. Furthermore, developers now have the ability to change their Droplet’s kernel, making upgrades using the API much more seamless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="getting-started"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to hear what you have to say as we continue to refine the direction of v2. You can find the complete documentation on the &lt;a href="https://developers.digitalocean.com/v2/"&gt;DigitalOcean developers portal&lt;/a&gt;. Let us know what you think on our &lt;a href="https://github.com/digitaloceancloud/api-v2"&gt;API v2 Github page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;SGP1 is the first datacenter to have IPv6 support because it is running v1.5 of our backend code base. The new version was completely rewritten from the ground up and provides many benefits over the current v1.0 code. This includes more actions that can be initiated without needing to power off a Droplet – such as enabling/disabling networking services – as well as an overall more reliable backup service architecture. After much testing during a two month beta period in Singapore, we’ve also started the first phase of our migration to the new 1.5 codebase in the San Francisco region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/blog/IPv6_Singapore/IPv6_Check.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building A Better Web With Track:js</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="from-the-creator"&gt;From The Creator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're bootstrapping Track:js, so we're perpetually short on time and money. We initially started using DigitalOcean for its price, but have stayed for nearly a year now because it works so well. Setting up Droplets is super easy and we have all the control we need to automate them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their systems are also incredibly fast and reliable, handling everything we've thrown at them. We hit #1 on HackerNews and saw 25,000 unique users hit our DO box and performance was stellar: less than 1s response on average. We host our public-facing sites on DigitalOcean using a combination of static files and WordPress. Deployment is automated with git hooks, which were straightforward to setup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean has been so great for us that we're looking to build out our usage capture components on a cluster of Droplets. We're very optimistic about this – it could save us a ton in monthly transactional costs and give us even more control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="more-than-the-error"&gt;More than the Error&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/blog/Track:js/telemetry.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error is the last in a long series of events. What happened before, what did the user do, and how did we get into this state? We built a custom event engine to track what the user, the network, and your application were doing leading up to the error. We call it the Telemetry Timeline – it's kinda like a BlackBox Recorder for your web app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="realtime-analytics"&gt;Realtime Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/blog/Track:js/dashboard.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of noise out there. A lot of errors are beyond your control. Our Analytics Dashboard helps you focus on the biggest impact. See the browsers, pages, or customers that are having the hardest time. Measure your app over time and see how your error rate changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="putting-service-in-saas"&gt;Putting Service in SaaS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're here to help you build a better app. My team and I are always &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#102;&amp;#121;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#097;&amp;#099;&amp;#107;&amp;#106;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;working with customers&lt;/a&gt; to integrate, improve, and fix issues of all kinds. We now receive over 1,500 JavaScript errors per minute. To ensure that we can keep up with that load and continue to scale, we leverage DigitalOcean's API to quickly spin up a dozen Droplets and hammer our systems with errors for performance testing. We build out an "error drone" template, which rapid fires fake requests at us, then create a swarm of them on demand. As a DigitalOcean user, you pay hourly for the test and tear them down. No other service is offering that kind of speed and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, Mark feels most valuable building teams and helping others succeed. His vast experience in operations and his passion for empowering developers is a contagious energy that's ignited our engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-decade-as-a-developer"&gt;A Decade As A Developer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markimbriaco"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; left school to found his own startup with a few friends: a web-hosting company called &lt;strong&gt;Internet Presence and Publishing&lt;/strong&gt; which they later changed to &lt;strong&gt;iTribe&lt;/strong&gt;. Their seed money came from a co-founder's father, and the little bit of cash was used to pay for "a tiny office, crappy furniture, and an internet connection."  But with a child on the way, Mark left the struggling startup to join a company where he could make some real money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would soon land a job building &lt;strong&gt;AOL&lt;/strong&gt; web services in the late 90's when everyone was using them. "It was a lot of fun, I mean, you've got 50 million people on the Internet and 25+ are connecting through AOL." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at this moment that I became a litte starstruck. Growing up as a kid, AOL and Netscape.com were the heart of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he wouldn't stay there long – his family hated living in Northern Virginia. Sacrificing one of the coolest jobs on the planet, Mark synced back up with a co-founder of iTribe to hack on &lt;strong&gt;html.com&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;christmas.com&lt;/strong&gt;. "The latter doesn't show up on LinkedIn because it's so ridiculous," he jokes. But there was unforeseen value in picking up those highly desirable domain names. Although the startup didn't take off, they sold the domains (and many others) to help fund the business and pay back investors. “I was proud we were able to do that – particularly my friend's father who put down the initial seed money."   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To most of us, leaving the biggest Internet company in the world to take a second chance on a startup may seem a little too risky. But following your heart is one of his biggest pieces of advice for young developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transitioning-to-operational-roles"&gt;Transitioning To Operational Roles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, Mark was a Java developer at &lt;a href="http://www.decisiv.com/"&gt;Decisiv&lt;/a&gt; for ﬁve years during the early 2000s, switching to Ruby and Rails for the last year of his tenure. When 37signals, now &lt;a href="https://basecamp.com/"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, went looking for a system administrator to help scale their systems, Mark jumped at the chance to get back into Ops work. He designed and managed the infrastructure powering Basecamp, Campﬁre, Highrise and all of the 37signals apps. After four years of massive growth, having become the Operations Manager and building a great team along the way, he decided he was ready to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a crucial moment for Mark –  at this point he's one of the most experienced people in the world at running Rails apps. And so at the peak of his career and overflowing with knowledge he decided to join Heroku. Over his two years at the PaaS, the company went from hosting 60,000 apps to over 1.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with nowhere to go but up, Mark Imbriaco made what he refers to as "the biggest mistake of my career."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark had a few friends at &lt;a href="https://www.livingsocial.com/"&gt;LivingSocial&lt;/a&gt; and felt restless working for Heroku after the Salesforce acquisition. But after joining, he realized he wasn't very passionate about daily deals."That was the biggest mistake I made," he says, "going somewhere I didn't care about the product."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="departing-from-github"&gt;Departing From GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; exploded with a huge &lt;a href="https://gigaom.com/2012/07/09/github-finally-raises-funding-100m-from-andreessen-horowitz/"&gt;$100 Million Series A from Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/a&gt;. Mark had known the founders for years and "believes in Marc Andreessen's assertion that software is eating the world and that developers are making that happen." Unlike his time at LivingSocial, Mark was passionate about building systems, tools and services that allow developers to work together.
Despite the lack of vertical structure, Mark showcased his natural leadership while heading the move into their own colocation facility. He also worked on strategies for updating the public status at GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whenever I wrote a post-mortem at GitHub, I didn't ask anybody before I published them. I would get feedback on grammar and wording from the team, but I didn't need to go to the CEO and ask. It was part of the culture and everyone wanted to be transparent."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark explains his formula for writing an ideal post-mortem:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apologize for what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Demonstrate you understand what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explain what you will do to reduce the likelihood of it happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're honest to customers and come off as genuinely empathetic, he explains, then you can turn a bad situation into the opposite – into something that actually builds confidence with your users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing his expertise could have a greater impact with a team underneath him, Mark decided to leave GitHub. When I asked what he was looking for in a new company, he responded simply "a place where I could have a bigger impact on a business with a product I cared about. I wasn't willing to sacrifice either of those this time." After speaking with Ben and Moisey, he decided DigitalOcean was that place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="vp-of-techops-at-digitalocean"&gt;VP Of TechOps At DigitalOcean&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished our conversation by discussing his &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/imbriaco"&gt;evolution from a developer to more operational roles&lt;/a&gt;. "I still like to get my hands dirty," Mark tells me. "I like to write code, I like to hack on things." But at this point in his life, he feels he can provide the most value when helping other people succeed. It took a long time and a lot of heartache along the way to settle into this new role – but now he couldn't be happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s typical of engineers to reach a certain level and feel there’s really nowhere to go but management. But management is not the continuation of an engineering career, it’s really starting over in a new discipline. You can either embrace this truth immediately, which is incredibly rare, or you take the role and rail against it for a while and complain about being in meetings all the time instead of writing code." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark likes to call it the "seven stages of technical grief." But he's come out the other side having a healthier perspective on things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I want to help other people succeed. I want to help grow teams. I want people on my team to have careers that are even more successful than mine. And I want to help expand our field because internet operations, and really anything web related, is just over 20 years old at this point. We're learning new things every day."&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Never Get Surprised By Your Monthly Invoice Again!</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This feature was inspired by a Hacker News user who &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7573660"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; on a thread saying, "Amazon should let us know if monthly bill &amp;gt; X and send me a priority email." Many of our own customers had already requested something similar in &lt;a href="https://digitalocean.uservoice.com/forums/136585-digitalocean"&gt;UserVoice&lt;/a&gt;, and it became clear that this was a great idea for any cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-it-works"&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can set up your billing alert by clicking on the &lt;a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings"&gt;settings icon&lt;/a&gt;. There you'll see a section called &lt;strong&gt;Billing Alerts&lt;/strong&gt; where you can adjust the threshold for your account. By default, we've set it to 125% of the average of your last three months of invoices (or $20, whichever is greater). If your Monthly Usage goes over the limit set, you will receive an email alerting you once per billing cycle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Billing Alerts" src="/company/blog/never-get-surprised-by-your-monthly-invoice-again/settingsalert-98d66e4e.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is simply an email notification.&lt;/strong&gt; No Droplets are suspended or destroyed. Your feedback will continue to drive our design process – if there are any other features you would like to see let us know &lt;a href="https://digitalocean.uservoice.com/forums/136585-digitalocean"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Super Fast Droplet Console. Thanks, Golang!</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first publicly visible service we’ve rewritten is our new web console. Using Go, we were able to dramatically decrease load and connection times from seconds to milliseconds. Aside from the immediate benefits, the console is also much more reliable and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What benefits did we get from using Go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goroutines made it easy to duplex the tcp and websocket connections, allowing us to dramatically improve the speed of the entire service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interfaces allowed us to build end to end testing, ensuring future updates are easier to ship and bugs can be fixed quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go’s built in net/http package means we are able to do live deploys and keep on-going development invisible to users. In fact, the three or four times that we have deployed code to the console since we switched to the new version were done with no interruptions or customer tickets being opened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go’s package system makes sharing code incredibly easy. That means we can share the code developed for the new console between projects seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more services that we rewrite in Go, the more we fall in love with the language and the more we feel it complements the development of distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way. If you’re a software engineer that’s interested in writing Go – we are &lt;a href="https://careers.digitalocean.com/"&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Easily Transfer Snapshots Between Accounts</title>

&lt;p&gt;As the receiver, you will have a new section on the &lt;code&gt;Images&lt;/code&gt; page titled &lt;strong&gt;Pending Snapshot Transfer Requests&lt;/strong&gt;. Here you'll be able to accept or decline the transfer request. If approved, the snapshot will disappear from the original user's account, as well as be added to your list of &lt;code&gt;Snapshots&lt;/code&gt; where you'll have full control over the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image Transfer" src="/company/blog/easily-transfer-snapshots-between-accounts/pic2-06f14dad.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of many exciting rollouts to celebrate the coming of Spring :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just a heads up:&lt;/strong&gt; as transferring a snapshot maintains all of the original snapshot’s settings, there may be configuration that allows the sender to potentially later access droplets created from the image. Make sure you trust anyone who gives you an image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Update: Heartbleed Vulnerability</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/heartbleed-vulnerability-update/"/>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many of you are now aware, yesterday the &lt;a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt"&gt;CVE-2014-0160 vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, better known as the “Heartbleed bug”, in the OpenSSL Project was disclosed. This is a serious vulnerability that will affect many websites and applications on the internet. As the &lt;a href="https://heartbleed.com/"&gt;researchers have said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without using any privileged information or credentials we were able steal from ourselves the secret keys used for our X.509 certificates, user names and passwords, instant messages, emails and business critical documents and communication.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have we done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as this vulnerability was disclosed to us, we immediately began the process of patching our internal systems to use the latest secured version of OpenSSL and updating our mirrors.  By noon today, all our infrastructure was updated and our certificates reissued, securing our internal and external facing assets and revoking our old certs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We advise our customers to follow the steps that we have taken for our own systems (where applicable)  to secure your own droplets. At this point, we have no reason to believe that any credentials have been compromised, but to be on the safe side we recommend you change your DigitalOcean.com and Droplet passwords.  Using the same password elsewhere (ill-advised in any case) may lead to your password being rendered unsafe again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also recommend you make a few precautions as a part of your normal workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a password manager that allows you to create strong passwords that are unique for every service you use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable two-factor-authentication for any critical infrastructure services you use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Periodically roll over your DigitalOcean API keys.  This means that you will have to &lt;a href="https://digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-api"&gt;re-issue your API key&lt;/a&gt; via the DigitalOcean.com control panel for any applications configured to use your old key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in the process of updating all of our installation images so that any new servers will be patched against this vulnerability from the time of deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about how to update your existing servers and protect yourself against this vulnerability, check out &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-protect-your-server-against-the-heartbleed-openssl-vulnerability"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
